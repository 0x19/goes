##Freeswitch Event Socket Library Wrapper for Go

GoESL is a small wrapper around [FreeSwitch](https://freeswitch.org/) [EventSocketLibrary](https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event_Socket_Library) written in [Go](http://golang.org).

Point of this library is to fully implement Freeswitch ESL and bring outbound server as inbound client to you, fellow go developer :)

**This package is in DEVELOPMENT mode. It does not work and I don't know when will I get it to work due to lack of the free time in this moment.**
